                While other plugins can be complex, simpleParallax. js is notable for its simplicity and impressive visual effects. The parallax effect is applied directly to image tags, eliminating the need for background images. Any image can be used.
                Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Click on the links below to see the difference between a website with and without parallax scrolling.
                <br><br>
                Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than
                the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth
                and creating a more immersive browsing experience. Parallax is based on optical illusion.
                Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as arger than things farther away,
                we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly. The illusion has been long adopted into
                parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. Its first use was in traditional
                animation,
                dating back to as early as Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and in video games such as Super
                Mario.
                With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the world of web design as we
                know it today.
                <br><br>
                The Parallax Effect is a difference in the apparent position of an object when viewed along two different lines of sight. The Parallax it's measured by the semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.A background image moves slowly, while images or graphic elements move faster in the foreground. This so-called "parallax effect" gives the user an impression of depth - the website appears like a 3D animation, which is continued by scrolling downwards.
                <br><br>
                That's a parallax effect, and it happens when the different elements of a page move at different speeds — creating a 3D depth effect. What's often happening is that the background image will be held in place or move slowly while the images and text on the page scroll normally.
                Parallax arises due to a change in viewpoint occurring due to the motion of the observer, of the observed, or both. What is essential is relative motion. By observing parallax, measuring angles, and using geometry, one can determine distance.
                <br><br>
                Parallax effects involve a website's background moving at a different speed than the foreground content. This visual technique creates an illusion of depth which leads to a faux-3D effect upon scroll.
